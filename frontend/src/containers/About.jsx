            <p>What if I told you to make 2,000 gallons of water to make the jeans you are wearing right now, you wouldn’t believe it.
                Nobody ever really thinks what it took to make a piece of clothing we just like it and buy it. </p>

            <p>
                The big problem in the fashion world today is that textile dying is the second largest polluter of water globally and
                majority of these textiles are ended up in landfills or burned because of:
                <or>
                    <li>sample exchanges between designer and factory supplier</li>
                    <li>design && specification inaccuracy</li>
                    <li>lost mail and emails</li>
                    <li>miscommunications between the two parties</li>
                    <li>hard to manage hard copy files for each product</li>

                Tekpack is your one stop shop to manage and keep track of all product specifications and its related content seamlessly.
                The whole process will cut down on waste in the supply chain and prevent costly mistakes in production. We’ve created a simple user
                interface that helps designers troubleshoot before any fabric is cut. These can be made  with real time updates and reduce human error
                to create a better communication flow between designer and factory. A user can also upload their own design and if and changes need to
                be made, they can upload a modified sketch that will be updated instantly for all parties associated on the project. Also for users/designers
                we’ve added an template option where they can choose from one of our basic templates. Further increasing productivity when working on designs
                with similar specs.

                <or>
                    <li>Designers to be able to send factories their url link. The supplier will have to sign up under the supplier account to
                access the designers projects. Supplier will not be allowed to edit images or measurements but they will be able to comment on designers projects.</li>
                    <li> Designers image will be dynamic where once a measurement is inputed the image would display the input in real time.</li>
                    <li>We also want to change our database to mongo db where we would be able to have a more (INSERT WHY)</li>
